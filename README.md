# What it does

Sends out mass emails using Python.
Used by CMUJSA for sending out notification emails to those who purchased tickets the previous year.

(We can also use the Andrew Mailman Mailing List, but oh well...)

# Setup

Download and unzip this repo (or `git clone`).

Go to the JSA PayPal account and download a .csv file for all ticket associated purchases from the previous year.

Allow third party access to your gmail account.
